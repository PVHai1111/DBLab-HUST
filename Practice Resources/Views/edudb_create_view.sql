--Since `student_class_shortinfos` is a view, you cannot directly insert/update/delete records from it. The view is essentially a virtual table derived from the underlying tables (`student` and `clazz` in this case) and reflects changes made to those tables.

--To insert/update/delete records, you would need to do so directly on the `student` and `clazz` tables. Any changes made to these tables will be reflected in the `student_class_shortinfos` view upon subsequent queries.

--Create a view from eduDB, named class_infos, this view contains:
--class_id, class name, number of students in this class.

CREATE VIEW class_infos AS
SELECT c.clazz_id AS class_id, c.name AS class_name, COUNT(s.student_id) AS num_students
FROM clazz c
LEFT JOIN student s ON c.clazz_id = s.clazz_id
GROUP BY c.clazz_id, c.name;

--3.1 Display all records from this view.

SELECT * FROM class_infos;

--3.2 Try to insert/update/delete a record into/from class_infos
--Since class_infos is a view, you cannot directly insert/update/delete records from it because it is a virtual representation of the data from other tables. However, you can perform these operations on the underlying tables (clazz and student tables in this case) and the changes will be reflected in the view.
